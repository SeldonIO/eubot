Dare to dream that the dawn is breaking on an independent United Kingdom.
This, if the predictions now are right, this will be a victory for real people, a victory for ordinary people, a victory for decent people.
We have fought against the multinationals, we have fought against the big merchant banks, we have fought against big politics, we have fought against lies, corruption and deceit.
And today honesty, decency and belief in nation, I think now is going to win.
And we will have done it without having to fight, without a single bullet being fired, we'd have done it by damned hard work on the ground.
And we'll have done it not just for ourselves, we'll have done it for the whole of Europe.
I hope this victory brings down this failed project and leads us to a Europe of sovereign nation states, trading together, being friends together, cooperating together, and let's get rid of the flag, the anthem, Brussels, and all that has gone wrong.
Let June 23 go down in our history as our independence day.
